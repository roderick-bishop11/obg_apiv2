# Our Black Gems API v2

OBG api was originally done as a project for undergrad. I wanted to build a database accessible via the API of black history. The idea was that if completed, users could utilize the API in their applications, websites, etc.

Well... that was a wash so I thought it'd be nice to redo this, new stack with a better design, and more support. Hell, maybe I could get this thing off the ground and get some contributors. ðŸ‘€

In any case, below I'll detail the upgrades, and path to that. Thanks for reading.
