# Our Black Gems (OBG) API v2

## Purpose

*"As long as we are not ourselves, we will try to be what other people are."*
-Malidoma Patrice Som√©

This API is a passion project, and aims to be an API that focuses on African-American history, literature, art, etc. We want to give black artists their flowers while they are here, and make sure that that we have some way to remember them for their work and their contribution to black beauty.

Each piece of our history is a "gem" and it's important that they are admired and learned about. It's so culturally important to have access to your history, and your value, especially in a place where we aren't so fortunate as to be valued.

It's my hope that this API will help African-American history be more accessible and that others will help to contribute to the cause. We have to educate ourselves on who we are and it starts here.
